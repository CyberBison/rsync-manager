## Overview

`rsync-manager` is a **macOS app** designed to simplify managing `rsync` backups. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and executing backup tasks. With this app, you can quickly define source and destination folders, run backups on demand, and monitor the status of your sync tasks.

### **Current Features**
- **Task Management**: Add and configure sync tasks with ease.
- **Folder Selection**: Choose source and destination directories through a simple UI.
- **Manual Sync Execution**: Trigger `rsync` commands directly from the app.
- **Sync History**: View the last sync date for each task (coming soon).
